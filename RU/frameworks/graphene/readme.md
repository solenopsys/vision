# Graphene

Achetectural framework for R&D laboratories





### Goals

- To create a cost-effective architectural framework that enables the rapid deployment of a global network of R&D centers and digital factories with virtual twins of production spaces.

- To create thousands of R&D centers with controlled spaces around the world within a few years, not decades. The approximate deployment speed is 1000 standalone buildings or one million square meters per year.

### Name

The project's name "Graphene" is derived from carbon nanotubes. This project is inspired and built in the image and likeness of these unique nanostructures.

The surface of the shells consists of a steel frame in the shape of hexagons and has a two-layer structure, similar to nanotubes. The load-bearing structure of the offshore platforms is also based on the repetition of this tubular architecture.

Thus, the key elements of the "Graphene" project draw inspiration and engineering solutions directly from the nature of carbon nanotubes - some of the strongest and lightest materials known to humanity.

### Inspired

This concept is inspired by the works and approaches of renowned architects. At its core are the innovative ideas of Buckminster Fuller - the use of thin shells capable of working in both compression and tension. 

Fuller's influence is seen in the solutions realized by Norman Foster, such as the load-bearing shells of the "Gherkin" building and the suspension of the HSBC Main Building. The concept of Le Corbusier's "House as a Machine for Living" and ribbon glazing is also reflected in this project. 

This is a bold and innovative approach that combines cutting-edge engineering and expressive aesthetics. The architectural style of the project follows its function - it is High-Tech.

**Key Principles We Will Employ:**

- Thin, load-bearing shells
- Structures working in both compression and tension
- Single elements performing multiple functions
- The building as a "machine for living"


## Experience of Others

Let's examine whether there have been precedents in history where businesses or states faced the necessity of rapidly creating global infrastructure. It is important to analyze these examples to understand which principles have already been applied and whether they can be adopted for our project. Additionally, we need to assess the historically possible parameters of infrastructure growth speed. This will help determine the feasibility of creating such infrastructure within a compressed timeframe.

We will start with examples from the business world, and then look at how the Mongol Empire expanded and what infrastructure they used.


### Historical examples of rapid building deployment

- McDonald's: Started actively developing in the 1950s and quickly achieved impressive results. By 1961, there were already over 500 restaurants in the US. Standardization was key to their success: the company developed a recognizable design with a red roof and golden arches, which became the brand's trademark. Today, McDonald's is present in over 100 countries, with a total of over 38,000 restaurants. Despite the impressive growth rate, the current deployment speed of new restaurants does not exceed 50 standalone buildings per year.

- 7-Eleven: Founded in 1927 and is now one of the largest convenience store chains in the world. Today, the company has over 70,000 stores in 17 countries. The key to successful expansion was the standardization of the format and service standards. Thanks to this, the company was able to ensure stable growth and increase the number of stores to 400 standalone buildings per year after 70 years of network development.

- IKEA: Founded in 1943 and began international expansion in the 1970s. Today, the company is present in over 52 countries, with a total of over 400 stores. IKEA is known for its unique approach to design and standardization, which has allowed the company to achieve impressive results and become one of the leaders in the furniture and home goods market. The deployment speed of new IKEA stores is about 10 standalone buildings per year.

Conclusions: All these companies used standardized buildings and simple architecture. The deployment speed of networks in the early stages of development did not exceed several dozen buildings per year. Our goal of 1000 means that the required deployment speed is an order of magnitude greater than any historical examples.

More efficient technological and logistical solutions are needed to achieve such a fast deployment speed. Let's look deeper into history for other examples of rapid expansion.





### Expansion of the Mongol Empire
The most successful example from history is the Mongol Empire and its mobile architecture - yurts.

Mongolian yurts had many advantages. They were quickly assembled and disassembled, easily transported by carts or pack animals, and provided comfort in various climatic conditions. Yurts were used in the conquest of Central Asia, where the rapid deployment of camps allowed them to advance hundreds of kilometers in a few weeks. Also, mobile camps provided a tactical advantage in campaigns in Persia and Europe.

Yurts, in essence, are mobile dome structures that played a key role in the rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire.

So, what conclusions can be drawn from the most effective examples of expansion of both ordinary and business empires? And what strategic decisions will allow us to ensure an order of magnitude greater deployment speed than the best historical examples?

- Like in biological systems, the production infrastructure should replicate itself.
- Standardized modular and mobile architecture is necessary.
- Module design should be suitable for mass production.
- In architecture, we will use dome systems and fractal scaling principles.
- To ensure fast deployment, it is necessary to use the already existing logistical infrastructure of the world and locate factories in the largest logistical hubs (seaports).
- Deployment should take place in parallel and simultaneously through reproduction via intellectual property by independent business structures around the world.

### Deployment in Any Environment

The core principle is "deployment in spite of, not thanks to". Just as trees push through asphalt, our buildings will be constructed where it is practically impossible: in the centers of megacities, in deserts, rivers, and even in the ocean.

The main goal is to rapidly deploy a global network of thousands of research laboratories worldwide. Our task is expansion, like an advancing army, regardless of the landscape or environmental conditions. Therefore, the architecture must be viable and adaptable to any conditions.

This approach will allow us to quickly establish our global network, regardless of geography and climate. Buildings constructed based on military engineering principles will have high mobility, strength, and scalability.

### Technology

Technology is the key word in this project, and the main principle is the use of technology to achieve goals. Without advanced solutions, it is impossible to solve the tasks at hand. High-quality technologies allow for much better results to be achieved using the same resources. The shape of a material often determines its efficiency.

The technologies we will use include:

* **High-strength materials:** UHPC, heat-treated steel, reinforced fibers
* **High-performance structures:** special-shaped trusses, circular structures, cable usage
* **Robotics application**
* **Laser technology usage**
* **Digital manufacturing and computer optimization**

These advanced technologies will enable the creation of strong, lightweight, and efficient structures for the project's implementation.

## Frame Structure

The frame structure comprises the following components:

- Rods/Bars
- Connecting Nodes
- Bolts

All frame elements utilize heat-treated steel with a modulus of elasticity of 1000 MPa (megapascals). In other words, these elements can withstand loads up to 10 tons per square centimeter.



### Nodes
The nodes consist of a steel ring with 6 holes for attaching the rods. Every other hole is designed to accommodate a wrench or socket for tightening the bolts.

### Rods
The rods are circular bars with a threaded hole drilled at each end to allow attachment and fastening using the bolts and nodes.

### Bolts
Hexagonal socket bolts are used.

## Concrete
In all structures, concrete will be actively used, with UHPC (ultra-high performance concrete), aerated concrete, and various compositions of these materials being utilized.

### UHPC (Ultra-High Performance Concrete)

UHPC is an ultra-high-strength concrete that exhibits high compressive and tensile strength, allowing the creation of thin-walled structures. Another advantage of UHPC is the reduction of structural weight, which enables the construction of more efficient buildings. For example, the strength of the first floor and foundation directly depends on the total mass of the building.

#### Technologies we will use:

- **Robot assembly**. Since our standard elements will be used in thousands, we will produce them with the help of robots.
- **Cutting of carbon fiber in place** before concrete production will be done using a carbon fiber thread for precise production of carbon fiber with the use of CNC cutting. This will allow precise control of the fiber length and percentage composition of lengths, as well as guarantee the quality of the initial fiber.
- **Ultrasonic mixing** of carbon fibers with a plasticizer. The peculiarity of carbon fiber is that it has a high surface tension coefficient, which makes fiber mixing difficult. Carbon fibers also have ten times more fibers per thread compared to glass fibers.
- **Ultrasonic compaction** of the concrete mixture.
- **Vacuum treatment** of concrete for rapid degassing and increased strength.
- **Rapid hardening** of concrete using autoclave heating significantly enhances its strength and  accelerating the process when using mass production.

#### Applications of UHPC:

**For creating floor slabs** - A new technology will be used based on thin-walled carbon fiber-reinforced UHPC, reinforcement, and a reinforcing mesh for concrete. The wall thickness of the slabs will be around 20 mm.

**For furniture creation** - Concrete tabletops, chairs, etc.

**Surface of aerated concrete panels** - Wall modules will be made of aerated concrete, with the surface layers consisting of UHPC.



### Aerated Concrete

Aerated concrete has a low density and thermal conductivity, which can be useful for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.  

Aerated concrete is a type of lightweight concrete that has a low density and thermal conductivity, making it a suitable material for creating wall modules and insulated floor slabs.

Main features and advantages of aerated concrete:

1. **Low Density**: Aerated concrete has a density ranging from 300 to 800 kg/m³, which is much lower than regular concrete. This reduces the load on the foundation and allows for a lighter building structure.

2. **Low Thermal Conductivity**: Due to the presence of small closed pores, aerated concrete has good thermal insulation properties. The thermal conductivity coefficient ranges from 0.07 to 0.18 W/(m·K), ensuring high energy efficiency and reducing heating and cooling costs.

3. **Sound Insulation**: The porous structure of aerated concrete also contributes to good sound insulation, making it an attractive material for interior and exterior walls.

4. **Fire Resistance**: Aerated concrete has high fire resistance and can withstand temperatures up to 1000°C without losing its load-bearing capacity.

5. **Durability**: With proper care and protection from atmospheric influences, aerated concrete can last for more than 100 years.

6. **Eco-Friendliness**: Aerated concrete is an environmentally friendly material that does not contain toxic substances and is easily recyclable.

Thanks to its unique properties, aerated concrete is widely used in the construction of energy-efficient buildings, as well as for insulating walls and floor slabs. Its lightness and strength make it an attractive choice for prefabricated construction.

## IGU - Insulated Glazing Unit



### Glass
Standard 4mm thick glass is used.

## Cylinders

- Closed
- Open

### Closed Cylinders
These cylinders have a closed end and are used as container lids. They can nest inside each other for compact storage and transportation. The closed cylindrical design allows for efficient stacking and space-saving when not in use as lids.

### Open Cylinder

We use non-equal-sided cylinders to enable dense packing. During storage or transportation, the cylinders can be nested inside each other, taking up minimal space in the container or warehouse. This approach helps to optimize space utilization and reduce storage and transportation costs.



### Genetic Code

 

Grafene will develop as a biological system, where increasingly complex structures will be created from basic elements, based on common principles. This approach is an essential necessity, as the project will evolve from small to large, from simple to more complex, and each stage will incorporate the technologies already mastered.

**For example**, at the first stage, simple buildings will be constructed, while several technologies will be implemented: convex double-glazed windows, a load-bearing hexagonal frame, rings of concrete slab segments, modular foam concrete partitions, and interior equipment ranging from air conditioners to power systems.

At the next stage, instead of a foundation, floating platforms will be created to support these buildings, allowing them to be placed in the rivers of large cities.

At the following stage, a marine floating platform for factories will be created, based on the technologies developed in earlier stages, and the robotic equipment from the workshops will be transferred to this platform.

Finally, the Ring platforms themselves will be created, which will also be built on the basis of technologies tested in previous stages.

This approach ensures the organic development of the project, where each new level of complexity rests on a solid foundation of previous achievements. This allows the creation of increasingly large-scale and ambitious structures, based on proven technologies and principles.

### Principles

### Power Connectors

For robust connectors, we will utilize computer power connectors commonly used for motherboard power supply. They have a
high permissible current and voltage and are cost-effective.

Another significant advantage of computer connectors is the redundancy of contacts. This allows for a substantial
increase in connection reliability through redundancy.

For high-power connections, we will employ Mini-fit connectors capable of transmitting up to 20 amperes with a maximum
voltage of 600 Volts AC (RMS) or 600 Volts DC.

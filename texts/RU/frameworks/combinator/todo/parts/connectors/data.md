### Data connectors

#### What are the connector requirements?
Small size, high retention reliability, shielded housing for shielded cables, current transmission of several amperes
per pin, Voltage Rating, ease of manufacturing in industrial conditions, the ability to assemble in home conditions, and
low cost, around $0.1 per connector.

#### Low Speed
This shielded connector supports data transfer speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. It is designed for most devices and
sensors, and it should be a straightforward connector with minimal pins.

#### High Speed
It supports data transfer speeds of up to 40 gigabits per second, enabling high-speed data exchange between FPGAs via
SerDes, video streaming through MIPI interfaces, and module connections using 10G Ethernet.

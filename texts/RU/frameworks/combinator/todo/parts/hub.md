### Hub

The Hub module is a board that contains multiple M2E connectors along one or more edges (using M.2 connectors
labeled B). The board contains an FPGA for integrating signals from connected modules. Each M2E connector is connected
to a separate FPGA port, allowing data transmission voltages ranging from 0.6V to 3.3V. Hub boards can be generated
using the Combinator platform service.

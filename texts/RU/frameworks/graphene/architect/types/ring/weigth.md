### Comparison of weights

#### Weight of skyscrapers

The weight of a modern skyscraper can vary significantly depending on its size, structure, materials used in construction, and other factors.

For example, the weight of the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, is estimated to be approximately 500,000 tons. However, this weight includes not only the weight of the building itself, but also the weight of the foundation, underground floors, and other components.

On average, the weight of a modern skyscraper can range from 100,000 to 300,000 tons, but these figures can vary significantly depending on the specific building and its characteristics. The average weight is 200,000 tons.

#### Weight characteristics of Graphene structures

Empty 20-story building - 2,000 tons (this is 1% of the weight of an average skyscraper)
Empty ring with a perimeter of 1 kilometer - 10,000 tons (this is 5% of the weight of an average skyscraper)

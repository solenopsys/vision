# Solenopsys - decentralized silicon valery

The name "solenopsys" is derived from the ants of the Solenopsis genus, where the 'i' is replaced with 'y' from the
word "systems." Solenopsis ants encompass numerous species, are found worldwide, and are known for their high
adaptability and rapid colony development.

In analogy to ants, each member of our community is like an ant, and the technological startups within the community are
different ant species. All these developers are located in various parts of the planet and collaborate to implement new
technologies.

### Robotization Structure

Robotization represents a hybrid structure that combines elements of a venture capital firm, an integrator, and a consulting company. Key features:

1. Lack of physical property and office buildings. Robotization does not have traditional offices or production facilities.

2. Investment in intellectual property and technology companies. The main focus is investing in promising developments and startups in the high-tech sector.

3. Remote and distributed structure. Robotization employees work remotely and are geographically distributed around the world, providing flexibility and access to global talent.

This approach allows Robotization  to remain a highly mobile and adaptive organization, capable of quickly responding to changes and trends in the technology sphere 
Similarly, this approach allows for the reduction of risks related to physical property under global business conditions.

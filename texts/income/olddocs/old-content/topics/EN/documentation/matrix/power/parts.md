### Parts

For safety reasons, the power supply is divided into 2 parts:

- **Low Voltage:** from 0 to 50 volts
    - Safe for human life and allows transmitting power up to 1 kilowatt per electronic module.

- **High Voltage:** from 50 to 1000 volts
    - Not safe for human life, but allows transmitting power up to 100 kilowatts per hub.

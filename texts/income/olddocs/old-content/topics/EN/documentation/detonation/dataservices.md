### Data Storage

In Detonation, we use different databases for storing data. Each database is connected to SHOCK Protocol, a protocol that
allows quick and easy access to data. The way people can access data is controlled by two methods. One is using the
security features of the databases themselves. The other is an extra security layer that checks who can access the data
using tokens and rules based on specific attributes.

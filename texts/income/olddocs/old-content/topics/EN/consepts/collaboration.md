### Collaboration

**Synergy** - an effect that enhances the outcome of two or more factors interacting, characterized by the collective
action of these factors being significantly greater than the simple sum of their individual actions.

One of the main tasks of the Solenopsys Ecosystem is resource savings through the synergistic effect and facilitating
the launch of new technologies in the field of technological development.

### Principles

**Division of Labor** - Everyone excels in what they do best. Some develop boards, others assemble and test, while
others invest. This approach leads to high productivity in innovation implementation. This division is made possible by
special licenses, the mechanisms of which are implemented on a blockchain through crypto licenses, allowing developers
to profit from small projects.

**Shared Computational Resources** - Member interaction involves not only the mutual use of developments but also the
joint use of computational power and data storage. Detonation allows scaling computational tasks across hundreds of
clusters scattered around the world.

**Compatibility through Standards**
Unlike typical OpenSource projects that aim to create and disseminate their code, the Solenopsys community strives to
integrate various existing tools into a unified decentralized environment. Here, these tools can complement each other
and increase their overall value.

**Unified Interfaces**
One of the challenges that Solenopsys addresses is the complexity of using open-source tools. These tools are easily
used only by programmers, and even then, significant efforts are often required for deployment, setup, and integration.
To use any Hyperconverged tool, just press a button. Then, it can be used from anywhere, be it a computer, tablet, or
phone.

**Code Deployment**
Unlike other communities where the criterion of progress is the publication of new software versions, in the Solenopsys
community, the main focus is on the deployment and use of code. Any code, after verification and publication in the
repository, will be automatically deployed on the Hyperconverged platform.

## Global Factory

### Idea
The Global Factory is a decentralized marketplace that integrates manufacturing services and products, facilitating
transactions between producers and consumers using blockchain technology for smart contracts and cryptocurrency
payments.

### Concept

The Global Factory is a marketplace for manufacturing services and products. It offers a wide range of production
services, such as 3D printing, printed circuit board fabrication, and more.

Participants of Solenopsys can list their products and services or purchase ready-made items. The registry is
decentralized, functioning as a distributed cache among nodes to reflect the system's state. All transactions are
conducted using cryptocurrency.

What sets the Global Factory apart from traditional marketplaces is that production specifications are stored separately
within the marketplace, and the production systems are integrated with the marketplace.

For instance, a manufacturer might not know about an STL file of a product stored on the Solenopsys community servers,
but they offer 3D printing services. A client can select any file, choose from a list of factories that fit their
technical process and price requirements, and place an order with the click of a button. The order is directly sent to
the production system, and the transactions are facilitated through smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Architecture

The Converged metaframework, based on Angular, draws inspiration from Vite.js and incorporates Angular and Bun.

#### Differences from Basic Angular:

- Utilizes its own development system.
- Own build system.
- Own module loading system from the decentralized platform.
- Binary data exchange protocol SHOCK.
- Proprietary module caching system.
- Proprietary state management system.

**Micro Frontends** - These are interface modules that can be dynamically added and extended. Users can create and
publish their own micro frontend on the Solenopsys platform, and other network participants can immediately use it.

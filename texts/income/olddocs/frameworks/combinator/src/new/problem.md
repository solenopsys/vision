### Problem

The total operational cost of industrial automation systems is tens of times higher than its production cost. This makes it difficult to create innovations as it significantly increases initial investments in new developments. 

This disparity arises due to two factors:  non-universality  and incompatibility

#### Non-Universality
- **High Per-Unit R&D Expenses:** Each board in industrial equipment is designed for a specific project, leading to substantial research and development costs and no ability to scale production to reduce the cost per unit.
- **Non-Universal Modules:** When a device consists of separate modules, each module often has connectors that are only compatible with this device. The same modules cannot be used to create different devices through reconfiguration or software adjustments, limiting flexibility and increasing the need for specialized modules.

#### Incompatibility
- **Interfaces, Connectors, and Protocols Incompatibility:** Each manufacturer follows and promotes their own standards, resulting in incompatibility between devices from different manufacturers.
- **Deployment Complexity:** The absence of universal standards and universal software makes the deployment process complicated and costly.

### Why is it important?
Currently, developing any new hardware-related technology requires several hundred thousand dollars just to set up the necessary infrastructure. This is an unattainable figure for most inventors or innovators. Meanwhile, the cost of the components that make up such infrastructure usually does not exceed $10,000.

Ten thousand dollars can be found almost anywhere, but half a million dollars is difficult to gather, even in the United States. This high barrier to entry stifles innovation and prevents the development of new technologies that could benefit a wide range of industries.

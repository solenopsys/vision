### Why is Creating Custom Chips Important?

Modern chips offer complex functionalities beyond the reach of traditional circuit board designs. This is particularly crucial for developing high-frequency (RF) devices, where the physical constraints and electrical properties of standard circuit board elements are unsuitable.

**Outdated Industrial Protocols:**
Current industrial data exchange protocols are severely outdated, operating at a throughput a thousand times less efficient than what modern technology can achieve.

**Historical Overview and Bandwidth Capacities**

- **I2C:** Created in 1982, with a bandwidth of 400kbps.
- **UART:** In use since 1962, speeds up to 100kbs.
- **SPI:** Introduced in 1979, capable of speeds up to 10Mbps.
- **CAN:** Developed in 1983, with speeds reaching up to 1Mbps.

To create new data transmission transmitters at a low cost, custom microchips are necessary, as small-scale FPGA units already cost an average of 3-5 dollars each.

Moreover, the scope of creation extends beyond integrated circuits. Most modern transistors, like GAN and FET, are manufactured using standard lithographic processes. Developing custom microchips is thus a major leap towards enhancing the functionality and cost-effectiveness of various electronic devices.

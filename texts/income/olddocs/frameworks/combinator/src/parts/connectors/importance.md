### Why are industrial connectors so important?

When creating complex industrial equipment that includes dozens or hundreds of electronic modules, the system's
reliability is determined by the modules' reliability by 50%, and the other 50% depends on the connectors. For this
reason, the cost of connectors can reach up to $1000 each.

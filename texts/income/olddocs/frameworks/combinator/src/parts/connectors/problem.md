### Why do we need to solve the problem of industrial connectors?

Combinator is a framework for creating digital factories, and any digital factory includes thousands of
interconnected modules. Therefore, without solving the issue of standardized connectors, it is challenging to achieve a
high-quality implementation of digital factory technology.

To create a scalable and reliable infrastructure, we need universal connectors with a very low cost, as otherwise, the
cost of these connectors will significantly impact the overall system cost.

As an example, the cost of simple devices like temperature sensors or limit switches can be $0.1, so the connector's
cost should not exceed the device's cost. With connectors priced at $20, it may seem like an unsolvable problem, but
there are excellent opportunities in the market to address this issue.

Various computer connectors that are widely produced and available at a minimal cost are now prevalent.

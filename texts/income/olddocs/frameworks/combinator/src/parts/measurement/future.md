### Strategy for Increasing the Accessibility

Our strategy revolves around designing relatively simple and cost-effective front-end modules for signal capture and its
digital conversion, leveraging our OpenSource chip technology. 

This approach is complemented by the use of OpenSource
software for data processing on existing computer accelerators like GPUs. 

Consequently, the most expensive component
becomes the computer chip for signal capture, while the rest of the system relies on software and standard computer
hardware.

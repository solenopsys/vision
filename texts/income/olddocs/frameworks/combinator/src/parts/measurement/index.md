# Measurement

Scientific research is an essential part of the innovation process and is necessary for the creation of new
technologies. New products with improved characteristics often go beyond the current technological boundaries.
Therefore, technological startups need to conduct scientific research and development.

To assess the results of development, any tests or scientific research require measurements. In modern conditions,
experiments and measurements can and should be fully automated.

The Combinator framework provides modules for the automation of measurements and experiments.

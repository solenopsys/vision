#### Robots

In popular perception, industrial robots are often associated with robotic arms widely used in car manufacturing.
However, in practice, these robots are quite versatile, albeit with a limited application range. Their precision under
high load conditions is inferior to specialized machines.

In a broader sense, an industrial robot is a device that combines motion actuators and various position sensors, which
can take different forms, such as linear motors or solenoids. The simplest industrial robot might consist of a solenoid
coil and a microcontroller that controls it.

Specialized devices such as 3D printers, CNC milling, and turning machines stand apart. Each of these types has unique
solutions, like specialized motherboards for 3D printers or controllers for CNC machines.

In modern times, such specialization is becoming less relevant. Virtually identical electronic modules are used in
various types of equipment, with the main difference lying in the software. Developing specialized hardware solutions
for different types of equipment is economically inefficient compared to using universal modules with specialized
software.

Combinator is an innovative framework that allows for the creation of diverse equipment, tightly integrated with
computer systems, on a common elemental base, opening new horizons in industrial automation.

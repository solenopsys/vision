### Example

Imagine you have a 3D printing business with several dozen 3D printers, each controlled by its embedded computer (like a
Raspberry Pi). When using the Detonation platform, they automatically form a cluster. The disk spaces of these printers
are also clustered, ensuring reliability, greater computational power, and large memory capacity for data storage.
Thus, slicing before printing can be done almost instantly, as it occurs across dozens of computers instead of just one.

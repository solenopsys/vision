
### Examples

Specifically, the distributed computations within the Detonation framework are applied to solve a variety of useful tasks, such as generative design, 3D printing of objects and circuit boards, physical process modeling, and working with various AI systems.

Here are a couple more examples:

- **To save a video stream from surveillance cameras to a hard drive:** The computer breaks down the video stream into a
  sequence of frames and applies various computational algorithms to compress the video stream.

- **To 3D print an object:** The computer first builds a 3D model based on initial vertices, then slices it into layers.
  For each layer, it creates a trajectory.

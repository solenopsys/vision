# Artificial Intelligence in the Development of Solenopsys (AIDDS)

Development with active use of AI for the Solenopsys platform.

## Goals

- **Optimization of the development process**: Achieve an 80/20 ratio where 80% of code generation is performed by AI tools and 20% by developer efforts.
- **Methodology development**: Create an effective and practical methodology for using AI tools within the Solenopsys community.
- **AI tools integration**: Integrate AI tools into the Solenopsys platform at the visual interface level, making them accessible to all community members.

## Success Criteria

- **Increased productivity**: One professional using this methodology should achieve the same level of productivity as a team of five.
- **Widespread adoption**: The methodology is actively used by most community members to accelerate development.
- **Tool accessibility**: AI tools are integrated into the platform and accessible through a visual interface to any community member.

## Limitations and Disclaimer

This approach is initially developed for Lead and Architect Developer levels, and its effectiveness may vary when applied to other levels. The system functions like a team leader, where AI takes on the roles of various participants, from experts to developers.

## AI Application in the Development Process

1. **Research and Development (R&D)**:
   - Expanding knowledge and developing new concepts.
   - Searching for the most efficient tools and technologies.
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of various approaches using AI.

2. **Architecture Development**:
   - Applying appropriate architectural patterns.
   - Generating interfaces and modules.
   - Automating the documentation process for architecture.

3. **Quality Verification**:
   - Generating various tests: acceptance, unit, and stress tests.
   - Automatically detecting and fixing errors.
   - Integrating AI into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes.

4. **Code Generation and Optimization**:
   - Automatically generating code based on specified requirements.
   - Optimizing existing code to improve performance.
   - Ensuring codebase compliance with standards and best practices.

## Methodology of Use

- **Concept Creation**: Using AI to generate and validate new ideas for novelty and efficiency.
- **Macroarchitecture**: Dividing the project into large functional parts for better management.
- **Prototyping**: Quickly creating prototypes and assessing risky approaches.
- **Project Architecture**: Building the structure of modules and interfaces based on project requirements.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Finding and applying suitable patterns to simplify tasks and reduce development costs.
- **TDD Integration**: Generating tests before writing code to ensure a test-driven development approach.
- **Modular Development**: Breaking down the system into small functional modules to make AI processing easier.
- **"MVP-Improve" Cycle**: Iterative development with the creation of a minimum viable product followed by quality improvements.

## Additional Capabilities of AI on the Platform

- **Personalized Learning**: AI can provide personalized recommendations and learning materials for community members.
- **Data Analysis**: AI can analyze large volumes of data to support informed decision-making.
- **Communication Improvement**: Automating routine communications and reporting within Solenopsys teams.

### Approach to Partner Collaboration

**Developers:** We invest in the intellectual property of developers and collaborate with them to create enhanced versions of their products, adapted to the requirements of industrial manufacturing.

**Customers:** When solving customer challenges, we form a team within their company and collaborate with this team to develop and implement solutions. In this scenario, we act as a consulting company, training teams and helping them effectively address their tasks.

**Contractors:** We are a management company responsible for production control. We place orders for component manufacturing with contractors and oversee all aspects of the production process.

**Investors:** We invest funds in a way that combines disparate elements into comprehensive, high-value-added products. We also invest in promising startups with high growth potential.

### Principles of Robotization Operation

- **Consolidation**: Acquisition of target assets in the market for the subsequent formation of complex products from them. For example, buying everything related to lasers to create laser processing complexes.
- **Integration**: Combining individual assets into a unified system. For example, connecting motion control drivers, motors, sensors using electronics and software to create a flexible robotic system.
- **Adaptation**: Modifying products to meet corporate standards (reliability, efficiency, availability), ensuring compatibility with each other, using industrial-grade components for 24/7 operation.

Robotization does not develop solutions independently. Instead, we make efforts to create quality corporate products from individual components by interacting with developers, contractors, and suppliers.

We also strive to create flexible partnerships without the use of physical property or control over enterprises, for example, through franchising and licensing of intellectual property.

Our task is to ensure control over intellectual property, transactions, and financial flows.

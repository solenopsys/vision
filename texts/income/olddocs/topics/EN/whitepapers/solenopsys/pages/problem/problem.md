### The Problem 
The current venture infrastructure is outdated and not effective, holding back the development of humanity, because it takes up space that could be used by a better, more efficient system.

#### Limited Access to Infrastructure
Most people in the world do not have access to the infrastructure required to make their ideas a reality. Silicon Valley is the only place on the planet where the venture infrastructure truly functions. Anyone who wants to launch a startup must come to Silicon Valley, but not everyone has that opportunity. 

The United States comprises only about 4% of the world's population, which means 96% of the global population does not have the chance to bring their ideas to life simply because they do not live in the USA. Such extreme centralization in a single location is highly ineffective in the modern world. But talented engineers and developers are found all around the globe.


#### Failing to Leverage New Possibilities
The Silicon Valley model operates on principles devised several decades ago. In reality, to obtain investments, one needs to physically attend meetings at specific offices, using traditional contracts. Yet today, we have remote communication tools and smart contracts - and these simply are not being fully utilized.

The Silicon Valley infrastructure is stuck in the past, failing to take advantage of the many powerful technological advancements available in the modern era. A more forward-looking and adaptable approach 

#### High Entry Barrier
The entry threshold for launching new technologies is extremely high. Realizing any new idea requires an enormous amount of work, with approximately 90% of the effort devoted to creating the necessary infrastructure, rather than on implementing the core concept. This pattern repeats itself across every company, both in terms of technology and organization.

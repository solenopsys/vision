### Low Voltage

#### 48 Volts

At 48 volts, there are several important advantages:

- High power, up to a kilowatt, can be transmitted to a single electronic module, and it remains safe for humans.
- Most connectors are rated for voltages not lower than 50 volts, which aligns with this voltage.
- There is a wide variety of affordable voltage converters with input voltages up to 60 volts.

#### 12 Volts
Used for internal power supply; this voltage is primarily required for controlling MOSFETs.

#### 3.3 Volts
Used to power various microchips, microcontrollers, and FPGA, CPU, GPU.

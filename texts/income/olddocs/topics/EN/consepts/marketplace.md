### Marketplace

On our marketplace, you can purchase products created by community members as well as a variety of services.

Here, you will be able to interact with product creators and freelance engineers.

The difference between our marketplace and others, like Alibaba or Amazon, is that we provide not only full product
documentation and source files but also engineering files and software such as drivers and configuration files. This
means that you can instantly integrate the device into your existing robotic system, receive technical support, or
engage with product creators.

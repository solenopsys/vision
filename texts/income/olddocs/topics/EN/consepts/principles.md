# Principles
**Simplicity** - we focus on developing simple solutions. Frameworks have a  straightforward architecture, and each individual module performs a simple function.

**Minimalism** - using a minimal set of fundamental elements in a variety of variations, with maximum reusability and
universality.

**Reactive** - real-time interfaces, data streams, and event-driven architecture.

**Rejecting NGX**, if there is a high-quality component with well-written code, it can be integrated directly into
UiMatrix, provided with a license, or linked to it in one of the ui-matrix libraries by creating a wrapper.

**Rejecting CSS frameworks**. For example, Material, Human, Fluent, Foundation, Bootstrap, Angular UI. These frameworks
impose strict constraints on interface design and do not align with the task of creating real-time interfaces for
digital factories, complex integration, and redundancy. We will use the best design system practices but focus on
creating a monolithic, modern, fast, and high-quality real-time interface.

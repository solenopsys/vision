## Scientific research

Solenopsys technologies are an ideal suite of tools for scientific research, especially when it involves creating
complex electronic equipment with hundreds of sensors. Using the Combinatorics system, one can easily design and manage
such equipment, including various motion control modules and a plethora of sensors.

In the realm of data processing and storage, the Detonation system plays a crucial role. It allows for the storage and
processing of vast amounts of information. This is achieved through distributed computing in Detonation clusters, powered
by robust central and graphic processors (CPU and GPU). These clusters not only process data with high efficiency but
also enable the storage of experimental results at very high data transfer speeds, reaching tens of gigabits per second.
Moreover, in the ShockWave system or on the Solenopsys Platform, data can be stored with virtually unlimited storage
capacity.

Solenopsys technologies also enable fully automated scientific research. This includes the use of robots based on
Combinatorics and high-performance distributed computing carried out in the Detonation system. Additional clusters can
be connected via the Solenopsys network as needed to increase computational power.

Furthermore, Solenopsys technologies facilitate collaboration and management of experiments in conjunction with
colleagues, including remote teams, through the Solenopsys platform. This simplifies the secure exchange of large volumes
of data with other laboratories located in different parts of the world.

### Matrix Rules System

Matrix is a key element of the Solenopsys ecosystem, as it enables effective interaction between thousands of participants in this ecosystem. This system allows participants to interact without conflicts and jointly create complex products, ensuring their compatibility through the use of unified standards, protocols, and guidelines. Thanks to this, products from various participants can work as a cohesive whole.

The system covers different levels of interaction, starting with the rules for interaction between participants and the rules for the operation of smart contracts, and ending with the physical implementation of industrial developments, virtual interfaces, and data exchange protocols.
 
### The design system consists of
- **Rules** - rules  for comunity members interactions.
- **Guidelines** - recommendations on how to do things right and well.
- **Standards** - mandatory rules and specifications in a particular field.
- **Protocols** - agreements on how devices or components interact and exchange data.

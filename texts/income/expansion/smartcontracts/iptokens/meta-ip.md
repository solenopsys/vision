### MetaIP

MetaIP - Property Rights for Technical Developments on the Blockchain.

IP, or intellectual property, is a key concept in MetaIP, inspired by the term IPCores. IPCores are ready-made blocks
used in microchip design, essentially files sold as complete products. During microchip development, a manufacturer buys
several of these blocks with different functions, connects them, and creates a finished microchip with a specific set of
features.

MetaIP extends beyond microchip design to encompass any equipment with digital descriptions, such as equipment
blueprints or electronic board designs.

Developers create a device, save it as files, and register the usage rights on the blockchain through a smart contract.

Equipment manufacturers can then produce the device based on these blueprints and pay the developer royalties for using
the design via the smart contract. Similar to music rights or NFTs, MetaIP deals with specific developments rather than
just ideas, like patents do. It offers a new paradigm for realizing and monetizing technical creativity in the digital
age.

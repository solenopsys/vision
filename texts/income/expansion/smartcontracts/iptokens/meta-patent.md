### MetaPatent

MetaPatent revolutionizes the patent licensing process by leveraging blockchain technology, simplifying and accelerating the licensing of patents.

Traditionally, patents registered in various countries require individual licensing agreements with each company, a process that is complex, time-consuming, and financially demanding.

The concept of MetaPatent introduces a virtual copy of a patent on the blockchain, linked to the actual patent registered across different countries. The smart contract within the blockchain specifies the licensing rules.

### Blockchain-Based Licensing
Blockchain technology facilitates the payment for license usage on a per-use basis, eliminating the need for individual licensing agreements. Patent holders can receive royalties without knowing who exactly is using the patent, similar to rights used in music licensing or NFTs. This method ensures a transparent, efficient, and secure way of managing patent licenses, opening new avenues for intellectual property utilization and monetization.

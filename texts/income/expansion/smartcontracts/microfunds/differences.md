### Differences in Funding Startups through Microfunds and Traditional Corporations.

| Traditional Corporations | Microfunds |
|-------------------------|------------|
| A corporation is an organization founded on groups of people. This group is structured through the internal framework of the corporation, which encompasses various resources, such as information systems and equipment. | Microfunds are based on intellectual property presented in the form of open-source code. |
| Typically, the financing of a corporation occurs through investments in commercial activities, requiring substantial amounts of money right from the start. | When developing a complex project, it is divided into a structure of microfunds, and funding is directed straight to the microfunds, bypassing the organization. Each microfund requires small investments. |
| The financing occurs in stages, and there is a high risk of project failure if the corporation cannot attract the next round of investments. | Each microfund receives 100% of the required capital at the time of the transaction, ensured by a smart contract that executes when 100% funding is reached. |
| Financial resources are invested in the organization's structure. | Each microfund is independent of others, with the goal of creating a product that can be used by other teams and in other projects. |
| In the event of project bankruptcy, the team dissolves, and a significant portion of the created value is lost. | Intellectual property is standardized for ease of use by other teams. In the case of project bankruptcy, a significant portion of the investments is preserved. |
| Intellectual property can be created based on know-how or patents. | A licensing agreement for the use of intellectual property is included in the source code. |
| Licensing of intellectual property is carried out through the conclusion of license agreements, which is a complex and time-consuming process. | Licensing is done through smart contracts, without the need for negotiations or even knowing who the counterparty is. |

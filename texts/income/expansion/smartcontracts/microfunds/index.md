## Microfunds

Microfunds - this is a new concept of financing technological projects. It involves breaking the project into separate micropojects, each of which creates a small, self-contained product with its own intellectual property. This approach is based on the use of smart contracts and open-source code.
Microfunds are established by community members to attract investments for their projects.

### Funds Distribution

Solenopsys Foundation is a nonprofit organization with the primary goal of developing the Solenopsys ecosystem. After receiving funds in the Foundation's account, a portion of these funds is directed to Hot Liquidity, while another part is allocated to the Development account, used to pay developers working on platform development. A smaller portion of the funds is used for the operation of Solenopsys Foundation, server expenses, and employee salaries.

Thus, a significant portion of the funds generated through emission is returned to the community in the form of liquidity. Solenopsys Foundation does not accumulate significant amounts of USDC on its accounts and immediately directs funds to infrastructure development. This approach minimizes the risk of capital loss due to hacking.

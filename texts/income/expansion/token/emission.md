### Emission

The emission of ECT tokens occurs only when they are purchased on our trading platform SolExchange. It's important to note that the quantity of issued tokens is not limited. Emission of tokens is possible only if there are no other participants on the trading platform willing to sell tokens at a price lower than 1 USDC. In such a case, ECT tokens will be automatically issued at a price of 1 USDC per ECT.

The Expansion.VC platform operates on the basis of the Stable Coin ECT, which is a settlement token. A portion of the funds (for example, 20% of the turnover) will remain in the Expansion.VC accounts.

This carries both opportunities and problems:

The problem is that the funds will be stored in cryptocurrencies, which carries the risk of loss due to failures or fraud. Additionally, large sums will become a target for hackers.

The opportunity is that the excess funds can be invested in various projects. This will increase the efficiency of the system, as a large part of the funds will work towards growth and development. It will also reduce the overall risks of resource loss and simplify the operation of the system.

### Microchips

The main goal is to develop fully open IP cores: SOC Risk5 + Fpga + NI, designed to control industrial devices.
Additionally, emphasis is placed on various IP cores for measurements and signal capture, such as those used in
oscilloscopes, as well as IP cores for data exchange protocols and new wireless protocols. Basic chip templates are also
being created, including input-output interfaces.

**Financial model** - Licensing fees for the use of IP cores.

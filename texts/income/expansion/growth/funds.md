### Funds Structure and Operations

#### Token Distribution
- Tokens are burned until 100% of the expenses are reimbursed. For example, if $10,000 was initially invested at the fund's launch, distribution among fund participants will not occur until this amount is received.
- 80% of the fund's tokens are allocated among the current growth team, distributed proportionally based on each member's contribution.
- The remaining 20% is allocated for financing Solenopsys Foundation operations, including server costs and developer compensation.

#### Fund Formation
- Each fund has its own objective and strategy outlined in its description, along with an initial fund volume.
- Fund sizes can vary from $10,000 to several million dollars, depending on available funds and goals.
- Asset investments commence immediately upon fund availability, and the fund closes upon reaching its volume threshold.
- Tokens can be traded on the marketplace immediately after the fund closes.
- Dividends from fund assets are directed back into the fund and distributed to participants.

#### Fund Management
- The fund may be sold entirely through participant voting, or assets may be sold from the fund via participant-approved voting.
- Changes to fund structure or operations require participant consensus through voting mechanisms.

### Assets Exchange

To enable participants on our platform to perform transactions with tokens, including smart contracts, and to convert ECT to USDC (a stablecoin), we are developing the SolExchange trading platform. The primary participant in this trading platform is Solenopsys Foundation, and its main function is token issuance.

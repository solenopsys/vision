### Market Makers

Market makers are special smart contracts that automatically conduct transactions between ECT and USDC tokens with a predetermined gap in price. For example, with a 10% gap, sales can be made at a price of $0.999, and purchases at $0.95. Market makers provide liquidity for exchange between USDC and ECT, earning from price differences.

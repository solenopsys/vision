**Globalization** is the process of ever-closer integration and interdependence of countries and peoples around the world in various spheres: economic, political, cultural, and others. 

**Supersociety** is a decentralized global community that is a superstructure over the modern system of nation-states built on the basis of territorial control and considering every citizen or enterprise as their property.

 Members of the supersociety operate and live globally, have transnational sources of income, and usually have multiple passports. The gradual formation of the supersociety is a direct consequence of globalization. There is no conspiracy here; the supersociety has been actively forming since the mid-20th century and began to develop rapidly with the dawn of globalization at the end of the century.

#### Globalization
Globalization is a positive process that increases the efficiency of all humanity, reducing the likelihood of military conflicts between countries. The main manifestations of globalization:
- A single global market for goods, services, capital, and labor. Transnational corporations.
- The development of information technologies and the internet for global information exchange.
- Increased migration of populations between countries and continents.
- The growing influence of international organizations (UN, WTO, IMF) on the economies and politics of countries.
- The interpenetration and blending of cultures of different peoples.

#### Deglobalization
Due to the rapid development of these globalization processes, as a reaction, reverse processes of deglobalization emerged:
- The disruption of global supply chains, reorientation to local suppliers.
- Repatriation of production by companies to their home countries.
- The rise of protectionism, trade wars, tightening of trade and investment regulations.
- The decline in the international movement of capital and labor resources.
- The fragmentation of the internet space, the pursuit of "digital sovereignty."

The problem with this process is that the logical conclusion of deglobalization could be a third world war with the massive use of nuclear weapons, which is beneficial to no one.

#### The Development of the Supersociety
With the emergence of deglobalization processes, the supersociety did not disappear, and it is merely preparing for its transformation and the acquisition of subjectivity by creating its own infrastructure not controlled by the outdated system of nation-states. Thus, if previously the supersociety was a decentralized part of states, now it is forming its completely independent infrastructure.

#### How it Works
In response to the 2008 economic crisis, Bitcoin and the vast crypto industry emerged. The crypto industry is essentially the financial infrastructure of the supersociety, and it already has a high level of development. Smart contracts will replace part of the outdated legal infrastructure. In response to border closures, including in the United States, the technological infrastructure will be taken out from under this jurisdiction.

#### The Function of Solenopsys
The task of our community is to form the technological infrastructure of the supersociety and ensure the subjectivity of the supersociety by forming the core of the community in an uncontrolled territory (a network of offshore marine platforms).

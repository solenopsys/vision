### What is Detonation?

Detonation is a computational framework designed for modern industrial applications. It is part of the **Solenopsys** ecosystem, created to accelerate the launch of technological startups and reduce the time and costs by **10 times**.

Detonation is developed for real-time data processing in industrial settings and research laboratories. It provides scalability and reliability for mission-critical tasks. The framework operates on devices ranging from a small Raspberry Pi, managing a personal 3D printer, to clusters of thousands of servers. These clusters are unified into a global computational network, offering immense processing power at the push of a button.

Detonation is closely integrated with other components of Solenopsys:

- **Expansion**: A decentralized platform for data storage, community interaction, and financial transactions. The entire global computational infrastructure of Solenopsys runs on Detonation clusters, forming the backbone of Expansion.

- **Combinator**: A hardware framework for creating modular robots, drones, and large-scale production lines. Detonation brings together thousands of Combinator devices into a single monolithic system, managing them like a conductor leads an orchestra.

- **Converged**: A UI framework providing a visual interface for interacting with all equipment. You can control any machine, drone, or entire digital factory from your smartphone or tablet.

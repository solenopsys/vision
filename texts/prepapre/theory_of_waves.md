## Deep and Shallow Sea

The ocean holds vast expanses of space, and positioning vessels there comes at no cost. For instance, land in New York may cost $25,000 per square meter, but just 300 meters offshore, you can station vessels of any size, even those as large as skyscrapers, for free.

Why is it so challenging to create a floating city or island in the sea, despite numerous conceptual designs? The primary issue lies in the fact that a floating island, even one of considerable size, will sway with the waves if it's not anchored to the seabed.

Why does this occur? The problem stems from the nature of ocean waves, which are formed by wind, the moon's gravity, earthquakes, and other factors. Most of the time, waves have relatively short lengths and amplitudes, such as 50 meters long and a few meters high. However, there are relatively brief periods, a couple of days a year, when hurricanes can form in the ocean. These hurricanes can affect the ocean surface for tens of hours, reach wind speeds of up to 100 km/h, and have wind influence ranges of several thousand miles. Under these conditions, long waves of 200-400 meters in length and amplitudes reaching 20 meters can form.

### Wave Force

In such sea conditions, even a floating island made of reinforced concrete, with a diameter of 1 kilometer and a mass of one million tons, would start oscillating at its own frequency, and these oscillations could reach several meters. In such circumstances, anyone would feel seasick. This is the main reason why floating islands are not built in the ocean.


### Methods of Counteracting Wave Motion

* Increase the object's size beyond the wavelength and make it round.
* Secure the object to the seafloor.
* Design the hull to be streamlined.
* Install stabilization systems.

How Large Marine Platforms Handle Waves:

These platforms are engineered to withstand extreme ocean conditions, including massive waves. Their construction relies on robust materials like steel and concrete, and they are designed to have a large mass with a low center of gravity for stability.

The foundation of these platforms plays a crucial role: deep-sea platforms are often anchored to the ocean floor using piles, while floating platforms employ complex anchor and mooring line systems.

The shape of the platforms also matters - many are designed to allow waves to pass through or around the structure, reducing the force of their impact.

Modern oil rigs are equipped with active stabilization systems, including computerized ballast systems that continuously regulate the platform's position.

These are excellent examples of wave resilience that we can learn from. However, even with these sophisticated measures, during storms, these platforms still sway, making it uncomfortable to be inside.



#### Can we solve this problem through technological means?

To address this, we need to examine the structure of ocean waves and the principles by which a wave's kinetic energy is transferred to a structure in more detail.


### Ð•nergy Transfer in Waves
Waves transfer energy as they move and break near the shore. As waves approach shallower water, their speed decreases, causing their height to increase until they break, releasing energy.

### Wave Energy Near the Shore
When waves break, they transfer energy to the shore, contributing to coastal erosion and sediment transport. The energy of breaking waves depends on factors like wave height, wave period, and water depth.


The terms "deep" and "shallow" refer to the relationship between water depth and wavelength, and the use of these terms allows scientists to describe the characteristics of wave propagation in various marine conditions. For example, in the theory of deep-water waves (in deep sea), equations can be simplified by ignoring the influence of the bottom. In shallow seas, on the other hand, the influence of the bottom and changes in depth become important.


### Deep Water Wave Theory

### Deep Sea:
A sea is considered deep if its depth is significantly greater than the wavelength. In deep sea, waves usually exhibit properties characteristic of deep-water waves. These waves do not feel the bottom, and their speed depends only on their length.



#### Behavior and Properties
In deep water, waves travel faster and are less affected by the seabed. Waves are considered deep water waves if the water depth is greater than half the wavelength. The speed of these waves is given by:
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}} \]
where \( v \) is the wave speed, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. This allows the waves to maintain their properties and energy over long distances.

#### Energy and Particle Motion
The energy of deep water waves is split between kinetic and potential energy. Water particles move in circular orbits, preserving wave shape and energy as they travel. This orbital motion diminishes with depth, minimizing seabed effects.

### Shallow Water Wave Theory

### Shallow Sea:
Conversely, a sea is considered shallow if its depth is comparable to the wavelength. In shallow sea, waves interact with the bottom, and their properties depend not only on the wavelength but also on the water depth. In this case, the formation of various types of waves, such as coastal waves, is possible.

#### Behavior and Properties
As waves approach the shore and enter shallow water, their behavior changes. In shallow water (depth less than one-twentieth of the wavelength), waves slow down, their wavelength shortens, and their height increases, leading to wave breaking. The wave speed in shallow water is:
\[ v = \sqrt{gd} \]
where \( v \) is the wave speed, \( g \) is gravity, and \( d \) is the water depth.

### Dependence of Wave Amplitude on Depth

The amplitude of a wave decreases with depth due to the diminishing effect of wave energy transfer. In deep water, wave-induced particle motion follows circular orbits, and the amplitude exponentially decreases with depth. The reduction in amplitude can be described by:
\[ A(z) = A_0 e^{-kz} \]
where \( A(z) \) is the amplitude at depth \( z \), \( A_0 \) is the surface amplitude, and \( k \) is the wave number. This illustrates that wave effects are most pronounced near the surface and decrease significantly with depth.

#### Breaking and Energy
When waves transition to shallow water, their kinetic energy converts to potential energy, increasing wave height. Upon breaking, significant energy is released, causing coastal erosion and sediment transport. Breaking waves form a foamy front, enhancing their impact on the shore.

#### Friction and Seabed Influence
In shallow water, friction with the seabed slows and deforms waves. Particle motion becomes elliptical, transferring energy from depth to the surface, leading to increased wave energy until breaking.

### Impact of Depth on Wave Energy
In deeper water, waves travel faster and with more energy. As waves move into shallower water, their energy is compressed, increasing wave height until they break.

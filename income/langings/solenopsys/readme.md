### Organizational Structure

Solenopsys is not a social network but a global network organization structured similarly to a mafia.

#### Organizational Foundation

The organizational structure of Solenopsys is borrowed from the MS13 mafia, excluding elements related to secrecy and law-breaking. Solenopsys is not a secret organization, and its members do not break the law.

#### Reasons for Choosing the MS13 Structure

MS13 emerged in the 1980s in the USA and has grown significantly despite opposition from government authorities, becoming a transnational gang with hundreds of thousands of members.

Advantages of MS13:

- Incredible resilience due to a decentralized structure.
- Ability to grow in an aggressive environment.
- Minimal skill requirements for ordinary members.
- Simplicity of organization.
- Resources and financial flows are confined within local gangs, making the organization robust.

#### Our Limitations

- We are building the community from scratch, forming it from the ground up, unlike the top-down approach seen in Silicon Valley. We rely on our resources and the crypto community, creating a new structure of innovation.
- We cannot guarantee high qualifications of participants and will rely on available personnel.
- To achieve our goals, we need a hierarchical organization capable of concentrating substantial financial and human resources.

#### Structure of MS13

Cliques are gangs, each controlling its territory. Each clique has a leader (shot caller) who manages the gang. Leaders can become mafia bosses, coordinating several cliques for large criminal projects like drug trafficking.

#### Structure of the Solenopsys Community

- **Groups**: Associations of people with common interests, formed based on professional, territorial, or organizational criteria. Groups are created by coordinators and managed by leaders.
- **Leaders**: Appointed by coordinators, leaders are responsible for recruiting new members and their initiation. They form teams for various projects.
- **Coordinators**: Manage projects involving multiple groups through their leaders. They set strategic goals, establish contacts with external organizations, create and disband groups.
- **Participants**: Join groups, have their own ratings and track records, which help determine their authority within the community.
- **Initiation**: Acceptance check for individuals and companies when changing status (Participants, Leaders, Coordinators, Corporations).
- **Provinces**: Groups united by certain characteristics, such as language or territorial affiliation.

### Detailed Descriptions

#### Coordinators

Coordinators play a key role in the Solenopsys structure:

- **Project Management**: Coordinators are responsible for projects involving several groups. They interact with groups through their leaders.
- **Forming Management Structure**: Coordinators establish rules and standards for the community. They define strategic goals and establish contacts with external organizations, such as corporations or government entities.
- **Creating and Disbanding Groups**: Coordinators create new groups and appoint leaders. If necessary, they can disband ineffective groups.
- **Achieving Status**: Coordinators must prove their competence by successfully implementing complex projects involving multiple groups.
- **Community Development**: Coordinators seek resources and opportunities to expand and strengthen the community.

#### Leaders

Leaders are central figures in group management:

- **Appointment and Management**: Leaders are appointed by coordinators and are responsible for managing their group.
- **Recruitment**: Leaders recruit new members to the group and oversee their initiation.
- **Team Formation**: Leaders know all group members and their skills, enabling them to form teams for various projects.
- **Advancement**: Effective leaders can become coordinators if they demonstrate high performance.

#### Participants

Participants are the foundation of the Solenopsys community:

- **Joining Groups**: Participants join groups based on interests or professional affiliation.
- **Working on Projects**: Each participant performs their role in the group and has their own rating and track record.
- **Initiation**: All participants undergo an acceptance check when joining a group and changing status.

#### Provinces

Provinces represent groups united by certain characteristics:

- **Criteria for Unification**: Provinces are formed based on language, territorial affiliation, or other significant traits.
- **Purpose of Provinces**: Facilitate coordination and interaction between groups with common interests or characteristics.

### Other Organizational Elements

These are not directly related to Solenopsys activities.

- **Projects**: Plans for product implementation.
- **Products**: What will be brought to market.
- **Teams**: Groups that create the product (not related to Solenopsys).

### Member Types in the Solenopsys Ecosystem

Within the Solenopsys ecosystem, there are several types of  members have privileges over regular users due to their contributions to the ecosystem's development. A regular user simply registers on the platform and does not have any privileges.To become a member, one must undergo an initiation process and prove that they are worthy of being our member. 

The community members types  names are derived from the subspecies of the Solenopsis ant:

- **invicta** ("invincible") - Main members who build and manage the infrastructure of Solenopsys.
- **saevissima** ("most fierce") - Startups and small companies that create new technologies within the ecosystem.
- **major** ("large") -  Transnational corporations that build offshore infrastructure and undertake major projects within the ecosystem.
- **stricta** ("strict") - Scientific community that provides scientific support for projects within the ecosystem.
- **goldini** ("golden") - Financial organizations, venture and crypto funds, and banks that provide funding for projects within the ecosystem.

Thus, the Solenopsys ecosystem brings together various types of participants, each contributing their unique expertise and receiving corresponding privileges and opportunities for growth and collaboration in return.

#### Invicta (Individuals)
- **Initiation Fee**: Independently solve a significant problem within the community.

- **Privileges**: Free access to the entire infrastructure. Influence over the vector of development and the ability to define the rules by which the system operates.

#### Saevissima (Startups)
- **Initiation Fee**: Developing significant technology for the ecosystem.
- **Privileges**: Free access to the entire infrastructure, communication with venture funds and corporations.

#### Major (Large Companies)
- **Initiation Fee**: Ordering a sea platform where the company's employees, R&D center, and data center will be located.
- **Privileges**: Control over their own sea platform and interaction with startups, scientists, and other corporations within the ecosystem.

#### Goldini (Financial Organizations)
- **Initiation Fee**: Investment of at least $1 million in projects within Solenopsys.
- **Privileges**: Creating funds within the ecosystem and attracting investments, interacting with any startups and corporations.

#### Stricta (Scientific Community Members)

- **Privileges**: Free access to infrastructure, opportunities to attract investments.

### Recruitment

The Solenopsys community is organized like a mafia to grow and spread rapidly worldwide. Each member can and should recruit new participants from their surroundings and seek contacts with target groups. Our community is not amorphous like most open-source communities but an organized army with a brain center and management.

**Where we will look for people and establish contacts:**

- Scientific circles and leading technological universities worldwide.
- Major technology companies, including military ones.
- Inventors and R&D companies.
- Open-source communities.
- Patent offices and government bodies related to intellectual property.
- Crypto communities, crypto funds, and cryptocurrency developers.
- The world's largest banks.
- Venture ecosystems in different countries (Silicon Valley, China, etc.).
- Influencers as an important target for community growth.

**Integration into language environments:**

In our ecosystem, we have the concept of provinces to facilitate interaction with local communities from different countries and language speakers.

**How we will build a recruitment database:**

- Analyzing global patent databases (Google Patents, WIPO) to identify productive companies and inventors and obtain their contacts.
- Parsing world university rankings.
- Parsing scientific journals and researcher ratings.
- Analyzing stock market data and annual reports of tech companies (Bloomberg).
- Parsing major venture platforms (TechCrunch).
- Parsing GitHub to find top contributors.

**Examples of recruitment:**

For instance, our goal is to create a group at MIT, one of the leading technological universities in the world. We will use the six degrees of separation rule to find one person inside and appoint them as the group leader. Their task is to expand the group by attracting students and professors from MIT. Each new group member should engage more people from MIT.

### Stages of Development

The ultimate goal is to create a fully decentralized innovation infrastructure that is accessible from any point in the world and surpasses Silicon Valley in all parameters.

Parameters by which it is necessary to surpass Silicon Valley:

* Capitalization of technology companies within the ecosystem.
* Annual volume of venture capital investments.
* Number and quality of innovations (patents and total value of intellectual property).

#### Development Stages:

1. **Creation of an efficient organizational structure** that is capable of rapid growth.
    * Formation of an organizational structure consisting of 1,000 members.
    * Establishment of the first 50 groups covering different areas of community development.
    * Formation of a full-fledged management structure, with each group having a leader and the system having several dozen coordinators who manage the organization's activities as a whole.
    * Implementation of the basic functionality of the platform for the community to function.
2. **Creation of a financial infrastructure** with a capital of $1 billion.
    * Attracting 100 financial organizations, mainly crypto funds and venture capital funds, with a total invested capital of $1 billion to the community.
3. **Deployment of a global physical infrastructure.**
    * Deployment of a network of 1,000 R&D centers based on Graphene technology in the large cities of the world through franchising partners.
    * Construction of 8 floating factories based on Graphene technology and their placement in major ports for container delivery to any point in the world through partners.
4. **Deployment of offshore infrastructure** in the form of 50 marine platforms near the largest cities, approximately in the same places where the data centers of cloud platforms AWS, Google, Azure are currently located.
5. **Achieving a leading position in the world of technology.**
    * Surpass Silicon Valley in terms of the number, quality, and volume of financing of technology companies.

The achievement of each of these goals is not planned to be ensured through corporate management, as is done by large companies, but through the creation of necessary conditions and technologies that will allow a large number of people and companies to join this process independently, pursuing their own interests.

This can be better illustrated by the example of how government programs to support entrepreneurship contribute to the development of small and medium-sized businesses, creating favorable conditions for their growth and development.

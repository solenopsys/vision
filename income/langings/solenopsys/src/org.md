### Organizational Structure

Solenopsys is not a social network but rather a global, network-style organization with a decentralized and hierarchical management model designed to ensure high resilience and efficiency.



#### Organizational Foundation

The Solenopsys structure is based on decentralized management methods, allowing members to operate within a unified network. We are not a secret society and do not engage in illegal activities.



#### Reasons for Choosing a Decentralized Structure

We draw on the experience of organizations that demonstrate:

- **Exceptional resilience** thanks to distributed structures  
- **Capacity for growth** even under adverse conditions  
- **Minimal skill requirements** for rank-and-file members  
- **Simplicity of organization**, easing scalability  
- **Local resources and funding** that remain within individual groups, enhancing the system’s overall reliability  



#### Our Limitations

- The Solenopsys community is built “from the bottom up,” nearly from scratch, unlike models where large corporations launch initiatives “from the top down.”  
- We rely on our own resources and the crypto community to form a new innovation structure.  
- We cannot guarantee a high level of qualification for all participants and will rely on readily available personnel.  
- To concentrate significant financial and human resources, we need a hierarchical model.



#### Basic Principles of the Structure

- Local groups, united by common interests or tasks, are led by leaders.  
- Leaders may join forces under the guidance of coordinators to tackle major tasks.  
- Decentralization allows quick responses to external challenges and effective resource allocation.



#### Solenopsys Community Structure

1. **Groups**  
   Associations of people formed by shared professional, territorial, or any other criteria. These are created by coordinators and managed by leaders.

2. **Leaders**  
   Appointed by coordinators, leaders are responsible for recruiting new members, overseeing their onboarding, and forming teams for various projects.

3. **Coordinators**  
   Manage projects that involve multiple groups. They set strategic goals, establish external contacts, and create or disband groups.

4. **Participants**  
   Join groups, each having their own rating and portfolio, which affects their authority within the community.

5. **Initiation**  
   A process of verification when someone joins the community or changes status (from participant to leader or coordinator, and also for company participation).

6. **Provinces**  
   Larger associations of groups based on language, territorial, or other common traits.



### Detailed Descriptions

#### Coordinators

- **Project Management**: They are responsible for projects involving multiple groups, working through group leaders.  
- **Structuring**: They establish the community’s rules, standards, strategic objectives, and external contacts (with corporations, government agencies, etc.).  
- **Group Creation and Dissolution**: Coordinators form new groups and appoint leaders. If necessary, they can disband ineffective groups.  
- **Status Elevation**: Leaders who prove themselves in complex, multi-group projects can become coordinators.  
- **Community Development**: They seek resources and opportunities for the community’s expansion and strengthening.

#### Leaders

- **Appointment and Management**: Leaders are selected by coordinators and are in charge of a specific group.  
- **Recruitment**: They attract new members to their group and oversee their onboarding.  
- **Team Formation**: Familiar with the skills of each member, they create project teams.  
- **Advancement**: Successful leaders may become coordinators if they demonstrate high performance.

#### Participants

- **Joining Groups**: Participants join groups aligned with their interests or professional backgrounds.  
- **Project Work**: Each participant fulfills their role, building a personal rating and portfolio.  
- **Initiation**: All participants undergo a verification process upon joining a group and when changing status.

#### Provinces

- **Formation Criteria**: Groups are united into provinces based on language, territory, or other significant characteristics.  
- **Purpose**: Provinces simplify coordination and collaboration among groups with shared features.



### Other Organizational Elements

These terms are not directly part of Solenopsys’s internal structure but are important for understanding how things work:

- **Projects**: Plans for implementing various products.  
- **Products**: Specific solutions that will be brought to market.  
- **Teams**: Specialized groups of professionals that develop products (not necessarily connected to the Solenopsys hierarchy).



Overall, the decentralized structure of Solenopsys focuses on community development, where each participant can find their role, and leaders and coordinators ensure efficiency and growth.

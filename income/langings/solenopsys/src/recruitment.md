### Recruitment

The Solenopsys community is designed for global growth and expansion. Each member can—and should—recruit new participants from their personal network, while also establishing connections with relevant audiences. Unlike many open-source communities, we are not amorphous; instead, we maintain a well-coordinated structure with centralized oversight.

**Where We Seek New Participants and Establish Contacts:**

- Scientific circles and top technological universities worldwide  
- Major technology companies, including those focused on military innovation  
- Inventors and R&D companies  
- Open-source communities  
- Patent offices and government bodies handling intellectual property  
- Crypto communities, crypto funds, and cryptocurrency developers  
- The world’s largest banks  
- Venture ecosystems in various countries (e.g., Silicon Valley, China, etc.)  
- Influencers as a key audience for community growth  

**Language Integration:**

In our ecosystem, we use the concept of “provinces” to simplify interactions with local communities in different countries and language environments.

**How We Will Build Our Recruitment Database:**

- Analyzing global patent databases (e.g., Google Patents, WIPO) to identify promising companies and inventors and gather their contact information  
- Scraping global university rankings  
- Parsing scientific journals and researcher ratings  
- Examining stock market data and annual reports of tech companies (e.g., via Bloomberg)  
- Scraping major venture platforms (TechCrunch)  
- Scraping GitHub to identify top contributors  

**Examples of Recruitment:**

For instance, we might aim to establish a group at one of the world’s leading technological universities. By leveraging the “six degrees of separation” principle, we find a single contact there and appoint them as the group leader. Their responsibility is to grow the group by recruiting students and professors. Each new member of the group, in turn, is encouraged to bring in more people from that university.

### Stages of Development

The ultimate goal is to create a fully decentralized innovation infrastructure that can be accessed from anywhere in the world, ultimately surpassing Silicon Valley on key metrics:

- Capitalization of technology companies within the ecosystem  
- Annual volume of venture capital investments  
- Number and quality of innovations (patents and total value of intellectual property)  


#### Development Stages

1. **Formation of an Efficient Organizational Structure**  
   - Establish a robust framework that can scale quickly.  
   - Launch multiple groups covering diverse areas of community development.  
   - Develop a comprehensive management system, where each group has a leader and several coordinators oversee the organization.  
   - Implement core functionality of the community platform.

2. **Creation of a Strong Financial Infrastructure**  
   - Attract a range of financial organizations (crypto funds, venture capital funds, etc.) to collectively inject substantial capital into the community.  

3. **Deployment of a Global Physical Infrastructure**  
   - Develop a worldwide network of R&D centers in major cities, in partnership with local franchises.  
   - Establish floating factories (e.g., based on innovative materials) in major ports to enable containerized delivery around the globe.  


The achievement of these goals is not planned through traditional corporate management models. Instead, Solenopsys focuses on creating the conditions and technologies that allow a broad range of people and companies to join inâ€”pursuing their own interests while contributing to the overall vision.

This approach is somewhat similar to how government entrepreneurship programs foster small and medium-sized businesses, providing favorable conditions that encourage growth and development.

#### Production - financing the production of hardware
- **Matrices** - production of matrices plastic, extrusion
- **Modules** - production of electronic modules

The fund is directed towards financing the production of initial batches of hardware. This includes projects with fully
automated assembly, such as the production of printed circuit boards and assembly of electronics. Financing occurs only
during the manufacturing stage, after which the batch is divided into smaller ones and distributed to sellers. Financial
transactions are carried out directly with the manufacturer, and batch storage is also handled by the manufacturer.

**Financial model** - Markup of 5-10% for batch production. The manufacturing cycle is about 1 month. The profitability
is 25% of the finished products.

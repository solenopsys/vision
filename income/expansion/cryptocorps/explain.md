### Crypto Corporation

Crypto Corporation (Cryptocorp) is an innovative company governed through a system of smart contracts based on blockchain technology. This applies to the delegation of authority, distribution of responsibilities, and management functions within the company.

The Crypto Corporation may include traditional legal entities whose activities are also regulated by smart contracts. The charters of these legal entities contain rules governing the execution of instructions received from smart contracts. At the core of the management mechanism are digital signatures, which currently have legal force in most countries around the world.

Through the use of digital signatures, a seamless integration of smart contracts with the traditional business environment is achieved. This allows the Crypto Corporation to operate in accordance with cutting-edge technological solutions while maintaining compatibility with existing legal norms and business practices.

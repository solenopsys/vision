### Crypto Gateways

Crypto gateways are legal entities in various countries that conduct fiat currency transactions between platform participants in accordance with the laws of the countries where they operate. This is necessary, for example, for wholesale purchases of goods in foreign countries through the Solenopsys platform. In this process, a transaction involves two legal entities acting as crypto gateways, one located in one country and the other in another country. The operation of crypto gateways is similar to that of crypto oracles, but in the reverse direction.

When a transaction is concluded, the operation takes place within the platform through a smart contract and is simultaneously duplicated in the real world. Smart contracts generate real-world contracts that are signed with the digital signatures of crypto gateways.

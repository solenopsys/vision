#### How does it work?

Let's assume you have an idea to create a new type of 3D printer based on your own technology. Here's how this process looks:

1. The project is broken down into individual components: motors, drivers, controllers, and various software modules.
2. Components that already exist based on the Combinatorics and Converged frameworks are identified. There's no need to develop them from scratch; you can simply purchase them or order manufacturing under license.
3. Those components that need to have unique characteristics are allocated to microfunds and brought to Matrix standards to easily integrate them into other projects.
4. Microfunds receive funding and commence development.
5. You create your project using the ready-made components from microfunds.

This approach reduces risks, cuts down development time, and lowers costs because it leverages pre-existing components and standardized solutions.

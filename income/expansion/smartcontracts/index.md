\### Smart Contracts

Each smart contract has its own internal token, which functions as a share for that contract. Additionally, each smart
contract can have its own logic. Smart contracts are used to facilitate complex transactions between participants. For
example, they can be used to create micro-funds for specific projects or venture funds that finance multiple projects by
purchasing their tokens. There are two types of smart contracts: regular ones that use the ECT token for settlements
and "Hot Liquidity" smart

- Microfunds - this is a new concept of financing technological projects.
- Funds - tokenized venture capital funds.
- IPT tokens -  like NFT tokens but for Intellectual Property Rights.

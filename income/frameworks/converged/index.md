**About the Product: What is it?**

Converged is a universal UI framework that is part of a decentralized platform designed to rapidly launch high-tech companies, startups, and conduct scientific research and development. Under the hood, it uses a rendering engine (browser engine), but the form of implementation can be any: a web browser on a computer, mobile applications for Android and iOS, applications for smart TVs, and other devices. Converged provides a unified interface for any tasks, combining thousands of modules from different developers into one powerful platform.

**Problem: What problem does it solve?**

The launch and development of high-tech projects are often complicated by fragmented tools and interfaces. Developers and startups have to use numerous programs and platforms, which slows down processes and increases costs. Converged addresses this issue by providing a single visual interface within a decentralized platform. It simplifies the development, integration, and scaling of projects, allowing you to focus on innovation and growth.

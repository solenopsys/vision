### Organic

In the beginning was the word, and that word was **Organic**.  From the simple command symbol **"o"**, every development in the ecosystem begins.

**Organic** is a modern CLI tool that combines an ultra-compact design with extensive expansion capabilities based on a modular architecture.

Organic unites opposites, like Yin and Yang:

- **Yin** — the solidity and speed of **Zig** for system tasks.
- **Yang** — the flexibility and power of **TypeScript** for business logic.



**Compactness and Efficiency**

The main distinction of Organic from other similar systems is its compactness. The executable file is less than one megabyte, yet the system supports tens of thousands of functions. This is achieved through the use of an ultra-compact JS Runtime that allows the execution of miniature JS scripts.

**CLI and Core Functionality**

The CLI system of Framework Organic is written in **Zig** and includes a compact JS Runtime (**QuickJS**). The core of the system contains about ten basic functions: file operations, networking, HTTP requests. These functions provide the necessary infrastructure for JS scripts, enabling them to interact with external APIs.

**Flexibility and Extensibility**

One of the key features of Organic is its minimalist command-line interface, where the symbol **"o"** serves as the entry point. Users can receive instructions from AI or execute direct commands—for example, launching a Detonation cluster on any cloud provider or creating a new project for the Cocon operating system. Built-in functions are loaded from the server as needed, ensuring ease of use and resource efficiency.

**Module Hierarchy and Libraries**

Organic employs a hierarchical module structure to manage tens of thousands of functions. Each module is a compact, compressed JS file that is loaded from the server only upon the first request and then stored on the client. Common dependencies, such as dynamic TypeScript interpretation, are offloaded to separate libraries, optimizing the development process. Additionally, the core functionality of Organic is extended through dynamic Zig libraries—for instance, QuickJS for executing JS scripts or LZ4 for decompressing objects.

**Collective Development**

The system is designed to involve a large number of developers who can create and add their own modules. After security verification and compilation via CI on the server, these modules are published and become available to all users. This ensures scalability and continuous system development.

**Goals**

Organic is a CLI tool that assists members of the Solenopsys community in development and infrastructure management. The system includes tools for creating and initializing frameworks, such as a module system for Zig. The main goal is to provide users with a powerful and convenient tool that simplifies working with global infrastructure and accelerates collaboration.

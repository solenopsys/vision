### Mission

The mission of Detonation is to make open-source computational algorithms easy to use and give the community access to vast computational power and data storage by pooling members' resources—offering capabilities usually available only to large corporations.

### Purpose

Detonation lets you easily control complex scientific experiments, processing real-time data from thousands of sensors—just as effortlessly as playing a game on your smartphone. It also allows you to manage swarms of drones or clusters of 3D printers with thousands of actuators as one unified system.

The future of engineering lies in the fusion of AI and high-performance computing. Detonation enables you to tackle tasks across various fields—from machine learning for PCB design to managing 3D printing processes. It helps optimize workflows through generative design and simulates physical phenomena like electromagnetism, materials, and mechanics. The system also allows you to model electronic circuits and analyze data from measurement tools like oscilloscopes and industrial sensors. All of this makes Detonation a powerful tool for solving the most complex engineering challenges.



### Why are Computations Necessary?

Computers are primarily designed for data processing. Even when you use simple interfaces on a smartphone or internet services, complex computational processes happen behind the scenes.
All your information is stored and processed in large data centers. That's where the necessary computations are performed - from data analysis to ensuring security.
Without these computational capabilities, modern technologies and digital services could not function. Computations are the foundation on which the digital world we use daily operates.

### Scalability

Detonation is scalable and can be deployed on a range of devices, from a basic computer like a Raspberry Pi to a cluster
of hundreds of servers, or on an HPC (High-Performance Computing) cluster in the cloud.

### Performance
The Detonation framework is capable of processing millions of tasks per second and handling data streams at hundreds of gigabits per
second in real-time.
Designed to operate without bottlenecks, Detonation encompasses thousands of data processing modules. These modules are
capable of functioning on a single computer or across clusters of thousands of servers.


### Efficiency and Reliability

Efficient use of computing resources and reliability are built into the architecture of Detonation. Maximum efficiency
in the use of computing power and disk space is achieved by utilizing all nodes for distributed computing and data
storage.

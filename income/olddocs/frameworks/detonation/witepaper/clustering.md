### Clustering

In developing Detonation, we've focused on minimizing resource usage — RAM, disk space, and CPU time — while ensuring scalability and compatibility. The Detonation platform is always ready to operate in a cluster, even when running on a single computer.

- Each Detonation node can be used for computations.
- Computations are managed through events, allowing for automatic load distribution across cluster nodes.

### Differences from Kubernetes

Kubernetes orchestrates containers in clusters, using microservices architecture with direct HTTP or TCP connections.

Detonation focuses on real-time data processing, deploying containers that interact via low-level Linux kernel functions for efficient load balancing and distribution, avoiding direct connections.

### Key Differences of Detonation Framework

The Detonation framework offers a fundamentally different approach to building high-performance systems compared to popular solutions like Kubernetes. Inspired by cutting-edge technologies—such as Kubernetes, IPFS, Google file systems, and modern compression algorithms like LZ4—Detonation doesn't integrate these technologies directly. Instead, it reimagines their underlying principles, implementing them at a low level to achieve maximum performance.

#### Minimal Footprint and Maximum Performance

Detonation was created with a focus on minimal system footprint and high performance, leveraging low-level functions and deep integration with the Linux kernel. Unlike Kubernetes, which is a general-purpose orchestrator designed to work with various operating systems and relies on manual configurations, Detonation focuses exclusively on low-level interactions with the Linux kernel, stripping away unnecessary overhead to optimize efficiency.

#### Real-Time Responsiveness

One of Detonation’s standout features is its ability to react in real time. Its event-driven architecture enables Detonation to respond to changes within 0.1 seconds—100 times faster than the average response time of Kubernetes. All interactions between components are event-based, ensuring rapid data processing.

#### Network Efficiency

Within hosts, data is exchanged via shared memory, while network communications leverage low-level network interface functions or non-blocking ring buffers at the kernel level. This setup enables a latency of just 10 microseconds for event transmission between nodes—an order of magnitude lower than the latency in Kubernetes.

#### Unique File System

Detonation utilizes a decentralized file system known as DDFS (Detonation Distributed File System), which is a hybrid between Google File System and IPFS. However, DDFS has been heavily modified to ensure maximum performance. This file system manages all devices in the system as a unified space through custom drivers designed specifically for this purpose.

#### No Go — Only Low-Level Solutions

Unlike Kubernetes, which is written in Go, Detonation is implemented using low-level C libraries and the Zig programming language. This decision was made to ensure the highest possible speed and performance. By avoiding Go, Detonation is able to use system resources more efficiently.

#### WASM Routers and Stateless Computational Functions

Detonation differs from Kubernetes in its use of WASM routers for managing program branching. Instead of microservices that can alter data, Detonation relies on stateless computational functions that only process data. The system's state is stored in a cache cluster, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

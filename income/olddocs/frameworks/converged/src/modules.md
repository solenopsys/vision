### Modules

Module loading happens dynamically from a decentralized platform. These modules can be cached on a local cluster or
mobile device, eliminating the need for a constant internet connection.

Dynamic loading enables any user to work with thousands of available modules, using the latest versions.

#### Example

Let's say you've purchased a 3D printer controlled by a Converged-based mobile app. All you need to do is install the
Converged mobile app, connect to the printer via wifi, and you can manage it using the mobile app.

When using the mobile app, it automatically loads all the necessary modules for printer control and saves them. As new
versions of modules appear, it updates them.

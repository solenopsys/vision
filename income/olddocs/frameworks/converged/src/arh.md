### Architecture
The framework features a modular architecture, making it flexible and easy to expand or modify. This means that anyone
connected to the network can create and publish their own web module or web application. Furthermore, these creations
are immediately accessible for use by any other network participant. Converged can support a vast array of visual interface
modules, each with unique functionality.

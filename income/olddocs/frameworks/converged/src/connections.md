### Connections

One of the main distinctions of the Converged UI framework lies in the connection options it supports.

#### Connection Options to the Control Object
- Direct connection to a decentralized platform, requiring no dedicated servers.
- Connection to a local cluster, for instance, a cluster of computers in a local network managing 3D printers.
- Direct connection to a device's microcontroller via the WebSocket protocol, e.g., connecting to a 3D printer.

#### Thus, there are 3 application scenarios for Converged:
- Online usage (on the internet).
- In a local network.
- Direct interaction with the device (without the internet and without computers).

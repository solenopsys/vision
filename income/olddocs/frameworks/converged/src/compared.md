#### Compared to other projects

In contrast to other open-source projects, which are typically aimed at managing 3D printers or CNC machines and are intended for single devices, Converged is focused on proffessional industrial and business applications.

**Examples of such projects:**
- OctoPrint - a web platform for managing 3D printers, oriented towards home use and the control of individual 3D printers.
- Fluidd - a user interface for Klipper, which is also oriented towards home use and has the same limitations.

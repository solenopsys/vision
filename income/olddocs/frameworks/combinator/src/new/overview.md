### Combinator  Framework

Combinator is a new industrial framework that enables the connection of different types of electronic modules into one device using FPGA hubs.  This allows modules with various interfaces and protocols to work together, while keeping signal delay very low. This modular design enables the creation of a wide range of devices for various industries using a limited number of standard modules.

#### Framework consisting of:
- Hubs that connect multiple electronic modules (h-Modules) into one device
- H-Modules, which are electronic modules that perform specific functions
- D-Modules, which are external modules with built-in microcontrollers for integrating with devices like sensors and motors
- Connectors, which are standardized for linking modules together.

### Name "Combinator"
The name "Combinator" reflects our project's focus on modularity and flexibility. Just as combinatorics in mathematics explores different ways to count, arrange, and combine objects, our system allows the combination of standard modules to create various devices. The name emphasizes our core idea: combining modules to unlock geometric progression number in potential devices.

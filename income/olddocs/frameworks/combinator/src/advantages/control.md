### Device Management

We move away from interactive screens built into equipment and any device-specific control elements. All types of equipment are managed through the unified UI interface of Converged.

Equipment may have small standard screens solely for displaying the current configuration and status of the device. Each piece of equipment should only have a power-on button.

### Control Options:
- Directly control the device's controller by connecting to it via a websocket over WiFi.
- Manage hundreds of devices operating in a Detonation cluster by connecting to the cluster via WiFi or remotely.
- Control multiple clusters of devices scattered around the world through the decentralized Solenopsys platform, connecting to it over the internet.

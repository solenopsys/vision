### Advantages of Smart Modules

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**: All connectors in the system are identical and have a standardized interface,
simplifying device connection to just plugging in a cord, with the rest managed by software.

**Transactional Data Transfer Interface**: Ensures certainty in device communication. There are only two outcomes:
successful or unsuccessful data transfer. Analog interfaces, prone to various interferences, can lead to rare but
damaging failures. Such faults are hard to diagnose.

**Continuous Device Monitoring**: Prevents a range of equipment malfunctions during operation. For example, a mechanical
limit switch with a broken wire will only be detected during operation. With smart modules, such issues are diagnosed
before the device starts working.

**Serial Module Connection**: Significantly reduces the number of wires needed for device connections.

**Reprogrammable Smart Modules**: Can change their operational algorithms through firmware updates.

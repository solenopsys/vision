### Current State of Measurement Equipment

In the realm of scientific research and the development of new equipment, a variety of measurement instruments are
employed. This includes devices like oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, signal generators, multimeters, etc.

Professional-grade measurement equipment can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, an oscilloscope with a bandwidth
of 40Gs per second can cost around $100,000. A similar pricing structure applies to spectrum analyzers.

Upon dissecting such an oscilloscope, it becomes apparent that its core indispensable components are the chip and the
board responsible for signal capture and digital conversion. A significant portion of the oscilloscope's cost can be
attributed to its software and data processing system.

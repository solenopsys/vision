#### Front Modules

Front modules are lightweight measurement modules whose primary function is to capture the signal under study, convert
it into a digital form, and transmit the data for processing to a cluster.


#### Detailed Steps for Implementation:

1. Develop OpenSource chips for signal capture and digital conversion.
2. Design minimalistic front-end modules for efficient signal capture and conversion to digital form.
3. Create Open Source software modules based on Detonation for data processing on existing computing technologies.
4. Develop Open Source modules for visualizing signals on various devices based on Converged.

### How much do modern industrial connectors cost?

Connectors are a highly technological area in industry. The reliability of complex systems depends directly on the
reliability of the connectors that link the system's modules.

Modern industrial connectors can cost tens of dollars each and are not always technologically advanced enough to create
cables using them on automated assembly lines. Cable assembly is often done manually.

The cost of an industrial connector is approximately $20. In comparison, the cost of a display port connector is about
$2, while the quality and technological level are almost the same.

### Why is This Feasible for the Solenopsys Community?

Thanks to OpenRoad, an OpenSource Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for chip development, the Solenopsys community is well-equipped to make significant advancements in chip design. We aim to integrate OpenRoad with Detonation systems, offering our community members a powerful yet user-friendly tool for creating their own chips.

Additionally, there's an active chip manufacturing program at the SkyWater facilities, supported by Google. This initiative enables any interested person to produce their own chip.

### Smart Modules

Smart modules are a key component of the Combinator architecture. Each module features an embedded microcontroller
and two UIC connectors, allowing them to be linked in chains. One connector is used for data input, while the other
connects to the next smart module.

Regardless of the cost of the sensor included in the smart module, even if it's as low as one cent, the module is always
equipped with a microcontroller and an industrial UIC connector. Despite the higher cost, this approach offers several
benefits that justify the expense, such as reduced installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting time for personnel.

### Conception

A modern industrial equipment control system should not resemble an electric control panel with a tangle of wires. It
should appear more like a server rack containing state-of-the-art equipment. Inside such a panel, there should be a
combination of high electrical power hardware and high-performance data processing systems.

The reason for the abundance of wires within control panels with machine controllers is the use of outdated standards
and data transmission protocols.

The Combinator framework introduces a new standard for expansion boards based on the M.2
interface, allowing the elimination of numerous wires and equipping equipment with high-speed data communication lines.

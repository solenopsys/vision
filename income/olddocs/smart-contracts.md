### Smart Contracts on Wasm: A New Standard for Blockchain Ecosystems

The core of this new smart contract concept is the use of precompiled WebAssembly (Wasm) templates. Instead of building each contract from scratch, users configure existing templates via an API.

### Key Advantages:

1. **Security**:  
   Templates are developed and tested by a specialized team. Users cannot modify the logic directly, minimizing the risk of errors or vulnerabilities.

2. **Performance**:  
   Precompiled Wasm code executes faster, reducing computational overhead and improving smart contract efficiency.

3. **Simplicity**:  
   Users configure contracts through an API with predictable behavior, simplifying development and reducing the chance of errors.

### Architecture:
- **API and Core**: A well-established core with tested API functions ensures stable template operations.
- **Templates**: Developed and tested separately from users, with configurations handled at the TypeScript level.

### Conclusion:
This approach combines security and performance with simple configuration, offering a predictable and efficient solution for building smart contracts.

### Goal

**Reduce the complexity of launching tech companies by 10x.**
Our goal is to radically simplify the process of creating and launching technology companies for people around the world. Instead of spending millions of dollars and years building the necessary infrastructure, we aim to reduce these costs by 99%, making key tools and resources readily accessible.

**For example**, what previously took $100.000 and 1 year can now be accomplished with just $10,000 and 1 month, thanks to Solenopsys ecosystem. This will empower millions of talented individuals globally to realize their innovative ideas and accelerate the progress of humanity.

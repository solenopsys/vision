### Programming Languages

At Detonation, we embrace a mixed paradigm in the use of programming languages. This approach allows us to leverage the
unique strengths of each language for specific tasks. Our microservice architecture, based on isolated containers,
facilitates this diversity seamlessly.
Despite the mixed paradigm, we focus on core languages to streamline development costs and enhance software quality.

#### Primary Development Languages

- **Golang**: Known for its simplicity, speed, and parallel processing capabilities. Ideal for lightweight microservices
  and network stack operations.
- **Zig** - A modern language with a simple syntax and a rich set of features. It is suitable for developing microcores based on C and C++. It is suitable for complex wasm modules.
- **C**: Used for developing microcontroller programs, Linux drivers and modules, and CUDA modules for data processing.
- **C++**: Suitable for complex programming on microcontrollers and advanced CUDA modules.
- **Python**: A versatile scripting language, perfect for backend experimentation, system scripting, AI, and data
  analysis.

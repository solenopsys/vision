### Databases
We use multiple databases, each tailored for specific tasks. These databases have a simple structure, are memory-efficient, and can run on various processor architectures.

- **PostgreSQL** - Great for large sets of uniform data. Known for being reliable, scalable, and supporting complex data
types, it's a preferred choice for managing organized data.

- **ClickHouse** - A specialized database for columnar data analytics, built for processing analytical queries in
real-time. Its design is fine-tuned for quick data queries and grouping, making it ideal for business analysis.

- **MongoDB** - Best for storing and managing large amounts of data that don't have a fixed structure. Thanks to its
adaptable design, it can manage different types of data, perfect for fast-paced development and growing applications.

- **Dgraph** - Designed specifically for data stored as graphs and for analyzing connections between data points. Its
graph-based approach is highly effective for detailed queries about relationships, providing fast data retrieval and
analysis.

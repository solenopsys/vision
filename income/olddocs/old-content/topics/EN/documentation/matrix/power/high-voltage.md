
### High Voltage 

#### 400 Volts

The choice of 400 volts is justified by the following factors:

- Availability of inexpensive switches, including most GANFET SICFET, with a nominal voltage of 650 volts. This ensures reliable electrical strength for these switches.
- There are many electrolytic capacitors on the market at a reasonable price with voltages ranging from 450 to 550 volts.
- The ability to control most powerful 3-phase motors, servo drives, and spindles without the need for transformer inverters.

#### 800 Volts

Using 800 volts when supplying high-power devices such as 3-phase motors, welding equipment, electrolysis equipment, induction furnaces, and powerful microwave heaters has the following advantages:

- Reduces energy losses during transmission and conversion, leading to cost savings on energy transmission cables.
- Enables the use of power factor correction modules (PFMs) based on SiC (silicon carbide) transistors in virtually any 3-phase power grid in the world, with voltages ranging from 380 to 600 volts. These PFMs have high efficiency and minimal losses.
- Resonant voltage inverters with an 800V input voltage also have very low losses, typically 1-2%.

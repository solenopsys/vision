### UiMatrix 

 In simple terms, it's a set of rules for developers creating
new products within the Solenopsys ecosystem. The idea is inspired by design systems created by major corporations for
their platforms, such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple.

**What sets it apart from other existing design systems** is that, while design systems from major corporations are
mainly focused on software, the Matrix design system covers various aspects of design and development, including design
rules for physical devices.

UiMatrix is a component library designed specifically for use with the Converged framework and is not adapted for standalone use. This allows for deep integration with other Converged resources and saves resources when optimizing individual implementations.

The system is flexible, open, and scalable. There can be many standards and specifications, each with its own name and
standard description. Standards and specifications will evolve with the introduction of new versions and the addition of
new elements. Since the platform is open, new standards will be added as needed.

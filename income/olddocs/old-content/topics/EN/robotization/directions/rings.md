### The Rings Project

The Rings project aims to deploy a controlled physical infrastructure for research and development (R&D). This involves building a network of R&D centers in the 1000 largest cities worldwide, equipped with the necessary facilities.

A controlled space refers to each physical office having its own digital twin. Updating the digital twin and subsequently synchronizing it with the physical space allows for controlling tens of thousands of offices as a single entity.

Each space has its own version and specific state. This means that changes made to each office can be tracked and managed centrally, ensuring consistency and control over the entire network of R&D centers.

Thus, the Rings project strives to create a global infrastructure for research and development, combining physical and digital spaces, which will enable effective coordination of R&D activities across the world.
